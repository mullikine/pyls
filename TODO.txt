TODO

* only conditionally update setup config with py2exe
* roll that back upstream to python-project-template
* how to make it easier to roll changes back upstream to p-p-template?
* accept command line directories specified as relative dirs (e.g. '..')
* nicer output for no args in directories with no packages or modules
* List module-level functions too.
* classes and functions exposed by a package (i.e. imported or defined in
  __init__.py) should show up in the output
* Test on Ubuntu
* Pester someone to test on a Mac for me
* Python 3
* Some way to differentiate classes from functions?
  e.g. func() or "def func()" and "class ClassA" ?)
* compact mode, that lists classes in a module on the same line?
* optional colored output?


DONE

* Initial release
* fix crash when pip installing on a machine that doesn't have py2exe installed
